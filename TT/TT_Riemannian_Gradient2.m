function [V,dUx,g_norm] = TT_Riemannian_Gradient2(A,U,residual)
%TT_RIEMANNIAN_GD computes the Riemannian gradient in implicit format
%This function is based on https://sma.epfl.ch/~anchpcommon/publications/ttcompletion.pdf
%   Inputs :
% 1. A contains the totl order sample polynomials
% for m = 4, d = 10, 600 samples, the size of A is 600 * (4^10),
% each row of A is the kronecker product of ten 4*1 vectors
% we dont want to compute A explicitly, so we store A as a 10*4*600 tensor
% 2. U is the initial guess of unknown in left orthogonal
% TT-format(except the last TT-core)
% 3. residual is the residial vector Ax-b
%   Outputs: 
% 1. V is the right orthogonalized U (except the first TT-core)
% 2. dUx is the direvative of the non-orthogonal part 
% There is another variable Ux used in this function, the unknown can be
% written as U_{k-}Ux_{k}V_{k+} for any index k. The TT-cores in U are left
% orthogonal, TT-cores in V are right orthogonal, the only non-orthogonal
% TT-core is Ux_{k}. The Riemannian gradient is computed based on the partial
% derivative with respect to Ux_{k}
% 
[~,~,n_samples] = size(A);
[d,m,r] = TTsizes(U);
V = U;
Ux = cell(d,1);
Ux{d} = U{d};
